<b> 1. detect-a-tree.py </b> <br />
A python code built using CNN and tensorflow to detect the presence of a tree in an image.  <br />
The directory structure of training and testing images are as follows:

basedata -> train, test <br />
train -> tree, nottree <br />
test -> tree, nottree <br />


<b> 2. redwood-vs-birch.py </b> <br />
A python code built using CNN, Tensorflow and keras to classify images based on barktypes. <br />
The 2 barktypes classified here are coastal redwood and paper birch <br />
The current accuracy rate is 67%, because only 100 images are used to train <br />
The directory structure of training and testing images are as follows: <br />
dataset_redwood_vs_birch -> train, test <br />
train -> birch, redwood <br />
test -> birch, redwood <br />
